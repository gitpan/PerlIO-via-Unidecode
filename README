NAME
    PerlIO::via::Unidecode -- a perlio layer for Unidecode

SYNOPSIS
      % cat utf8translit
      #!/usr/bin/perl
      use strict;
      use PerlIO::via::Unidecode;
      foreach my $f (@ARGV) {
	open IN, '<:encoding(utf8):via(Unidecode)', $f or die "$f -> $!\n";
	print while <IN>;
	close(IN);
      }
      __END__

      % utf8translit home_city.txt
      Bei Jing

DESCRIPTION
    PerlIO::via::Unidecode implements a PerlIO::via layer that applies
    Unidecode (Text::Unidecode) to data passed through it.

    You can use PerlIO::via::Unidecode on already-Unicode data, as in the
    example in the SYNOPSIS; or you can combine it with other layers, as in
    this little program that converts KOI8R text into Unicode and then feeds
    it to Unidecode, which then outputs an ASCII transliteration:

      % cat transkoi8r
      #!/usr/bin/perl
      use strict;
      use PerlIO::via::Unidecode;
      foreach my $f (@ARGV) {
	open IN, '<:encoding(koi8-r):via(Unidecode)', $f or die $!;
	print while <IN>;
	close(IN);
      }
      __END__
[...]
